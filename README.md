# Simpletest 1.0.1 for PHP 7.3+
An unofficial port of [Simpletest](http://simpletest.sourceforge.net/) 1.0.1 to PHP 7.3.

**:warning: Only use this code, if you have an active Simpletest 1.0.1 version that you have to port to PHP 7+!
Otherwise use a better Unit-Testing-framework!**

## Why does this exist?
If you have a CakePHP 1.3 installation you know, that it requires Simpletest 1.0.1.

If you [upgraded CakePHP 1.3 to PHP 7+](https://github.com/littleant/cakephp-1.3.21), you need an upgraded Simpletest 1.0.1 for PHP 7+, too.

This is an attempt to make a usable Simpletest 1.0.1 for PHP 7+ happen.
